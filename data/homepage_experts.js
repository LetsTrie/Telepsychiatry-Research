    bio:
      'I am an enthusiastic researcher-practitioner in the field of clinical psychology and I love to divide my time between clinical practice, training, consultation, and research. In my clinical practice, I deliver cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and other evidence-based treatments to adult and adolescent clients with a wide range of emotional, behavioral, adjustment, and chronic health related problems such as anxiety, stress, depression, trauma, chronic pain, drug addiction, and relationship problems. I am also a certified ADOS-2 administrator and I have conducted more than 500 ADOS-2 tests. In my consulting work, I have provided intensive supervision to trainee clinical psychologists as they acquired skills to deliver CBT in their own practice. I am passionate about changing the mental health service scenario in Bangladesh by conveying evidence based services to people and generating a positive impact on their life through quality care. I am eager to apply my experience and compassion with clients as they begin to address issues that will help them to improve their quality of life and attain a sense of fulfillment. I have always been involved with extra-curricular activities since my college days. I have been a volunteer and organizing member of different national and international conferences organized by Department of Clinical Psychology, University of Dhaka. I have also facilitated different workshops and seminars on different mental health related issues such as stress management, anger management, assertiveness training, parenting training, chronic pain management, psychological first aid, mindfulness etc.     I have received my B.S. with honors in psychology, M.S. in clinical psychology, and M.Phil in Clinical Psychology from University of Dhaka.
